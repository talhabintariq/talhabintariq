      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-white/80">
        I&apos;m <span className="font-semibold text-white">Talha B. Tariq</span> â€” a software engineer and consultant with over 7 years of experience 
        building modern web applications and practical AI solutions. 
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-white/80">
        My journey has taken me through roles at <span className="font-medium text-white">Sony PlayStation</span>, 
        <span className="font-medium text-white"> Robinhood</span>, and <span className="font-medium text-white">NTT Data</span>, 
        where I worked on projects ranging from enterprise-scale applications to fast-moving product launches. 
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-white/80">
        I specialize in <span className="font-medium text-white">React, Next.js, and FastAPI</span>, with a growing focus on 
        <span className="font-medium text-white"> AI systems</span> such as RAG chatbots, agents, and automation workflows. 
        My approach is simple: build things that look clean, scale well, and deliver real results. 
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-white/80">
        Outside of engineering, I&apos;m also a digital artist, blending creativity and technology into everything I do.
